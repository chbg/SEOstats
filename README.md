# PageRank Me

PageRank Me is an open source tool for figuring out the theoretical amount of Google PageRank (http://pr.efactory.de/) a web page would receive from an external web page through a single instance of a backlink. PageRank Me is a fork of eyecatchup's SEOstats repository (https://github.com/eyecatchup/SEOstats) because it enables PageRank Me to effortlessly pull PageRank data from the Google API.
